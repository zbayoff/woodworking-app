1. add slug to backend for routing: 
https://woodworking-app.com/posts/jigs/crosscut-sled
https://woodworking-app.com/posts/joints/dovetail

2. Dockerize the app

Can one blog post have many categories? 
Say an article on dovetail joints...this article could have categories joints, and jigs (if there is a jig needed for this joint)

3. Store blog images in S3 (and their metadata in Postgres? )

4. REMOVE ANYS

5. Make sure no spaces when ading multiple categories in form

categories:
jigs
joints
plans
